# Cafeteria Management System (DSA Project in C)

## Project Overview
This project is a **Cafeteria Management System** implemented in **C**, showcasing core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.  
It demonstrates how different DSA techniques can be applied to solve real-world problems like menu management, order processing, and history tracking.

## Features (Mapped to DSA Concepts)
- **Arrays – Menu Management**
  - Store and display menu items with IDs, names, and prices.  

- **Search & Sort**
  - **Bubble Sort**: Sort menu items by price.  
  - **Binary Search**: Search for items using their ID.  

- **Stack – Undo Order**
  - Use a **stack** to undo the last placed order.  

- **Queue – Order Queue**
  - Use a **queue** to manage and serve customer orders in **FIFO** order.  

- **Linked List – Order History**
  - Maintain an **order history** using a linked list.  

- **Trees – Food Categories**
  - Represent food categories using a **binary tree** and display them in preorder traversal.
